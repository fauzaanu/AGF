## Want to contribute?

This repo is open for contributions if there are people interested. However as there is none at the moment, 
I dont intend to keep any rules. If you want to contribute, just make a PR and I will merge it if it makes sense.

Please understand that this is meant to be an opinionated framework rather than offering every possible option.
